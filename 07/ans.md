# Debugging and Profiling
## Debugging

1. Use journalctl on Linux or log show on macOS to get the super user accesses and commands in the last day. If there arenâ€™t any you can execute some harmless commands such as sudo ls and check again.

`journalctl --since "yesterday" | grep "sudo"`

2. Install shellcheck and try checking the following script. What is wrong with the code? Fix it. Install a linter plugin in your editor so you can get your warnings automatically.

```
Line 3:
for f in $(ls *.m3u)
         ^-- SC2045 (error): Iterating over ls output is fragile. Use globs.
              ^-- SC2035 (info): Use ./*glob* or -- *glob* so names with dashes won't become options.
 
Line 5:
  grep -qi hq.*mp3 $f \
           ^-- SC2062 (warning): Quote the grep pattern so the shell won't interpret it.
                   ^-- SC2086 (info): Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting.

Did you mean: (apply this, apply all SC2086)
  grep -qi hq.*mp3 "$f" \
 
Line 6:
    && echo -e 'Playlist $f contains a HQ file in mp3 format'
            ^-- SC3037 (warning): In POSIX sh, echo flags are undefined.
               ^-- SC2016 (info): Expressions don't expand in single quotes, use double quotes for that.
```
